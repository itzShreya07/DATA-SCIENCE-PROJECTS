# Netflix Data Science Projects

## Project Overview
This repository contains data analysis and recommendation system projects based on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset.  
We clean, explore, and visualize Netflix data and develop a content-based movie recommendation system using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Streamlit.

## Project Structure
- **Notebook:** `Netflix_data_analysis.ipynb` – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization.  
- **App:** `app.py` – Streamlit app deploying the movie recommendation system for interactive user experience.  
- **Data:** `netflix_processed.csv` – Processed dataset used in the app and notebook.  
- **README.md** – This documentation file.

## Features
- Handles data cleaning: duplicates, missing values, and feature engineering.  
- Visualizes key insights: top genres, countries, content release trends.  
- Builds a recommendation system with TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.  
- Interactive UI for movie recommendations via Streamlit app.
